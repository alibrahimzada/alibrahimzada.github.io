I am a CS PhD candidate in the <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/" target="blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/" target="blank">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>, IL, United States. My research interests include LLMs for Code, Code Translation, Software Testing, Program Analysis, and Deep Learning. Moreover, I am a member of the <a href="https://reyhaneh.cs.illinois.edu/lab.htm" target="blank">Intelligent CAT Lab</a> advised by <a href="https://reyhaneh.cs.illinois.edu/" target="blank">Prof. Reyhaneh Jabbarvand</a> since Fall 2022.

Moreover, I am a Visiting Scholar at [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/) - IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States. I mainly focus on repository-level programming language translation using LLMs.

Feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:alirezai@illinois.edu">email</a> if you are interested in my research.
