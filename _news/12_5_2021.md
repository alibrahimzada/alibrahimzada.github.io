I'm glad to announce that I have been accepted to work as a Research Intern in "Software Engineering & Machine Learning" at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA.

After finishing my previous research internship at <a href="https://www.itu.edu.tr/en/homepage" target="blank">Istanbul Technical University</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://web.itu.edu.tr/alicakmak/" target="blank">Dr. Ali Cakmak</a>, I am thrilled to be working with <a href="https://reyhaneh.cs.illinois.edu/" target="blank">Dr. Reyhaneh Jabbarvand</a> from <a href="https://www.cs.illinois.edu" target="blank">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a> on Test Oracle Inference project this summer. I believe this is a great opportunity for me to dig more deep into my research interests and get ready for grad school.

In the Test Oracle Inference project, we will use deep learning techniques to construct an automated oracle. To train the model, we will consider the CFG (control flow graph) coverage of tests, the input, and the tokens of the code under test. To help the model distinguish between correct and buggy code, we will use first order and higher-order mutants for the purpose of training. The model takes a test, test input, and the code under test as an input and predicts whether the test passes or fails.

Here is to another summer filled with research, coding, and fun. I can't wait anymore to get started.
