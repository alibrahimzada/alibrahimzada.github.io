	title = { Predicting Student Grades in Courses: A Clustering-Based Approach},
	abstract = {Intelligent systems are getting more popular for predicting student success and obtaining useful insights from educational data. Traditional educational institutions fail to fully utilize their students' data to enhance their instructional setting. Interpreting large amounts of educational data may be quite essential for institutions. For instance, such intelligent systems may address questions like “how many credits should a particular student be allowed in a semester in order to improve her grade point average with no or minimal extension on her graduation time?” or “which students in a class should be proactively offered additional tutoring to increase the success rate of a class?”. A fundamental problem that needs to be dealt with while addressing such questions is predicting a student’s success in a particular course ahead of time. In this paper, we propose a general clustering-based framework to estimate the grades of students in a course before the course commences. The clustering-based framework allows the grouping of similar students prior to fitting a learning model. Using a separate model for each group of similar individuals can significantly increase the grade estimation accuracy, as it is much easier to find patterns in a more homogeneous student group. We demonstrate the application of the proposed grade prediction model on a real-life dataset. The experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms the state of the art by approximately 36% improvement in error rates.},

	title = {Predicting the Predisposition to Colorectal Cancer based on SNP Profiles of Immune Phenotypes using Supervised Learning Models},
	abstract = {The goal this study is to explore the machine learning-based assessment of predisposition to colorectal cancer based on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Such a computational approach may be used as a risk indicator and an auxiliary diagnosis method that complements and supports the traditional methods such as, biopsy, CT scan, and MRI. Moreover, it may be used to develop a low-cost screening test for early detection of colorectal cancers to improve the public health. Finally, individuals with high risk of acquiring colorectal cancer may be advised appropriate life and nutrition style to minimize the effect of the environmental factors. The employed dataset includes SNPs observed in particular colorectal-cancer-associated genomic loci that are located within DNA regions of 11 selected genes, namely, MDM2, GAL3, TIM1, TRAIL, PD-1, PD-L1, p16540, p16580, CD28, CD27, and CD40. The dataset is obtained from 115 individuals (50 healthy (control group) and 65 colorectal cancer patients). The dataset also includes additional information for patient group; such as, the age of the patient, the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, perineural invasion of the tumor, and tumor differentiation. We employ several supervised classification algorithms, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forests (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Besides, we apply data imputation to fill the missing genotype values. We make the following observations: (i) Logistic Regression-based classifier using one-hot encoding for feature representation and knn-based imputation to complete the missing data performs the best among the studied classifiers in terms of both f1-score (88%) and AUC value (0.88). (ii) Knn-based data imputation increases the f1-scores around 18% (from 70% to 88%). (iii) The proposed model outperforms a commonly employed state of the art approach, ColonFlag. (iv) Based on the high accuracy of the constructed logistic regression models, the studied 11 genes may be considered as a gene panel candidate for the risk screening of colon cancer. (v) Based on the ANOVA analysis, the following genotypes are the statistically significant (i.e., p-val < 0.05) discriminating features between the control group and colon cancer patients: C/C and C/T in CD40, C/C and T/T and CD28, C/T in PD-1, C/T and C/C in TRAIL, T/T in CD27, A/C and A/A in PD-L1, and C/C in GAL3. This shows that the colon cancer is associated with multiple genes in complex interactions.},
