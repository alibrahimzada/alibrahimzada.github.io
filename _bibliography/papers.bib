	title = {Perfect Is the Enemy of Test Oracle},
	abstract = {Automation of test oracles is one of the most challenging facets of software testing, but remains comparatively less addressed compared to automated test input generation. Test oracles rely on a ground-truth that can distinguish between the correct and buggy behavior to determine whether a test fails (detects a bug) or passes. What makes the oracle problem challenging and undecidable is the assumption that the ground-truth should know the exact expected, correct or buggy behavior. However, we argue that one can still build an accurate oracle without knowing the exact correct or buggy behavior, but how these two might differ. This paper presents SEER, a Deep Learning-based approach that in the absence of test assertions or other types of oracle, can automatically determine whether a unit test passes or fails on a given method under test (MUT). To build the ground-truth, SEER jointly embeds unit tests and the implementation of MUTs into a unified vector space, in such a way that the neural representation of tests are similar to that of MUTs they pass on them, but dissimilar to MUTs they fail on them. The classifier built on top of this vector representation serves as the oracle to generate “fail” labels, when test inputs detect a bug in MUT or “pass” labels, otherwise. Our extensive experiments on applying SEER to more than 5K unit tests from a diverse set of opensource Java projects show that the produced oracle is (1) effective in predicting the fail or pass labels, achieving an overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measure of 93%, 86%, 94%, and 90%, (2) generalizable, predicting the labels for the unit test of projects that were not in training or validation set with negligible performance drop, and (3) efficient, detecting the existence of bugs in only 6.5 milliseconds on average. Moreover, by interpreting the neural model and looking at it beyond a closed-box solution, we confirm that the oracle is valid, i.e., it predicts the labels through learning relevant features.},

	title = {Predicting the Predisposition to Colorectal Cancer based on SNP Profiles of Immune Phenotypes using Supervised Learning Models},
	abstract = {The goal this study is to explore the machine learning-based assessment of predisposition to colorectal cancer based on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Such a computational approach may be used as a risk indicator and an auxiliary diagnosis method that complements and supports the traditional methods such as, biopsy, CT scan, and MRI. Moreover, it may be used to develop a low-cost screening test for early detection of colorectal cancers to improve the public health. Finally, individuals with high risk of acquiring colorectal cancer may be advised appropriate life and nutrition style to minimize the effect of the environmental factors. The employed dataset includes SNPs observed in particular colorectal-cancer-associated genomic loci that are located within DNA regions of 11 selected genes, namely, MDM2, GAL3, TIM1, TRAIL, PD-1, PD-L1, p16540, p16580, CD28, CD27, and CD40. The dataset is obtained from 115 individuals (50 healthy (control group) and 65 colorectal cancer patients). The dataset also includes additional information for patient group; such as, the age of the patient, the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, perineural invasion of the tumor, and tumor differentiation. We employ several supervised classification algorithms, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forests (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Besides, we apply data imputation to fill the missing genotype values. We make the following observations: (i) Logistic Regression-based classifier using one-hot encoding for feature representation and knn-based imputation to complete the missing data performs the best among the studied classifiers in terms of both f1-score (88%) and AUC value (0.88). (ii) Knn-based data imputation increases the f1-scores around 18% (from 70% to 88%). (iii) The proposed model outperforms a commonly employed state of the art approach, ColonFlag. (iv) Based on the high accuracy of the constructed logistic regression models, the studied 11 genes may be considered as a gene panel candidate for the risk screening of colon cancer. (v) Based on the ANOVA analysis, the following genotypes are the statistically significant (i.e., p-val < 0.05) discriminating features between the control group and colon cancer patients: C/C and C/T in CD40, C/C and T/T and CD28, C/T in PD-1, C/T and C/C in TRAIL, T/T in CD27, A/C and A/A in PD-L1, and C/C in GAL3. This shows that the colon cancer is associated with multiple genes in complex interactions.},

	abstract = {Accurately identifying organisms based on their partially available genetic material is an important task to explore the phylogenetic diversity in an environment. Specific fragments in the DNA sequence of a living organism have been defined as DNA barcodes and can be used as markers to identify species efficiently and effectively. The existing DNA barcode-based classification approaches suffer from three major issues: (i) most of them assume that the classification is done within a given taxonomic class and/or input sequences are pre-aligned, (ii) highly performing classifiers, such as SVM, cannot scale to large taxonomies due to high memory requirements, (iii) mutations and noise in input DNA sequences greatly reduce the taxonomic classification score. In order to address these issues, we propose a multi-level hierarchical classifier framework to automatically assign taxonomy labels to DNA sequences. We utilize an alignment-free approach called spectrum kernel method for feature extraction. We build a proof-of-concept hierarchical classifier with two levels, and evaluated it on real DNA sequence data from barcode of life data systems. We demonstrate that the proposed framework provides higher f1-score than regular classifiers. Besides, hierarchical framework scales better to large datasets enabling researchers to employ classifiers with high classification performance and high memory requirement on large datasets. Furthermore, we show that the proposed framework is more robust to mutations and noise in sequence data than the non-hierarchical classifiers.},
